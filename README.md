# HybridAStar
Hybrid A Star

Hybrid A Star algorithm which is useful for unstructured planning for autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics.
With a small modification of applying weight to the A* heuristic (Weighted A*), making it faster at the cost of sub-optimality.

The user has access to the start position, goal position, start yaw, and goal yaw.
